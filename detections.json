    "description": "This rule looks for instances where there has been a OneDrive file sync of a file where the file extension has changed. This rule covers both OneDrive and SharePoint, however as SharePoint is built off a OneDrive backend all events appear as \"OneDrive\" events. This activity can be indicative of ransomware on a host machine where the files are synchronised to a OneDrive or SharePoint repository. This will be especially useful for organizations that have external / guest users utilising collaboration infrastructure within their environment. OneDrive/SharePoint typically has a delay of 10-20m for the event pull. Additionally OneDrive/SharePoint will generate a lot of logs. Therefore the recommended scheduling is 10m looking over a 15m time window.",

KQL enables rapid searching of large SharePoint sites, utilising unique \"Queriable\" fields such as \"FileExtension\". Whilst this feature is useful for legitimate purposes, attackers may exploit it to quickly locate sensitive information, developer tools, or system administration utilities that could aid in further compromise or lateral movement. The rule specifically looks for KQL searches targeting file extensions commonly associated with scripts or configuration files (.ps1, .bat) or containing keywords that might indicate sensitive information (\"password\", \"ipconfig\").
