This activity typically uses command-line utilities such as powershell.exe or cmd.exe targeting the RDP client operational log. Adversaries may clear RDP logs to erase evidence of remote access or lateral movement. The rule triggers when process creation or command script events contain wevtutil with the cl flag and specify the RDP client log. This behavior is suspicious and may indicate attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized RDP activity.",

A TAP is a time-limited passcode that satisfies Microsoft Entra strong authentication requirements, like multi-factor authentication requirements implemented by conditional access policies. An adversary that established an initial foothold into cloud infrastructure may be attempting to compromise privileged accounts by registering and using TAPs. Account owners won’t be alerted about this change and their existing password and registered MFA mechanisms will continue to work properly. By gaining control of privileged accounts, an adversary might be able to establish additional persistence, widen access, and progress towards their attack goals. By default, all TAP registration events are detected. To limit the detection scope to privileged accounts only, add additional query filters to match those accounts. Known False Positives: If TAP is used during user onboarding or MFA registration process, newly created accounts will also trigger this detection.",
